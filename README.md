# Steam Marketplace Fee Calculator

## Overview

This JavaScript program calculates the variable marketplace fee on Steam based on item value. Since the fee varies with each 10 cents addition, it requires automation or a formula involving summation. Not finding such a formula, I decided to create this program.

## Features

- **Fee Calculator**: Determine the applicable fee based on item value.
- **Addition and Subtraction Operations**: Add or subtract the fee from item value as needed.
